// You are an IT company's manager. Based on their performance over the last N working days, you must rate your employee. You are given an array of N integers called workload, where workload[i] represents the number of hours an employee worked on an ith day. The employee must be evaluated using the following criteria:
// Rating = the maximum number of consecutive working days when the employee has worked more than 6 hours.
// You are given an integer N where N represents the number of working days. You are given an integer array workload where workload[i] represents the number of hours an employee worked on an ith day.
